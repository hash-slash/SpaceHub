# SPACEHUB--pygame

This game is made using the python module pygame, which consists of two elements namely a moving spaceship and meteors, which you have to dodge using the spaceship controls. 
However if the coordinates of the spaceship and the obstacle happen to be the same, it ends in a collision and the game ends. 

Motivation behind the project :

It was designed as a time-killer game to fight boredom and anxiety. Got nothing to do ? Play a bit of SpaceHub, zone out in the game and have some time off without feeling
guilty !!!
It also enhances your focus and brain stimulation

How to  play the game ?

1. Install pygame using pip install pygame on your local device. (preferably v 2.1.2).
2. Clone and run the github repo on your local device and you are good to go.
